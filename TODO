- Some code cleanup, make easier to define new widgets and inherited widgets, use macros like SIMTK_PROPERTY_DATA, SIMTK_PROPERTY_CTOR, SIMTK_PROPERTY_DTOR, etc, etc that are basically all the same.
- Jump to specific offset (this implies writing a text editor widget)
- Global file view (like a global scroll).
- Configuration support (it looks like there are some people that just hate the font and the orange-over-black color scheme). 
- Section colorizing for commonly found file types.
- Disassembly (capstone / radare2 / libbfd).
- Debugging support (connect to gdbserver, paint segments, stack structure, etc)
- Binwalk integration.
- Scripting.
- Some basic editing support.
- Resize SDL window.
- Resize bit views and hexdump width for other structure sizes.
- Add a menubar and a help window (menu widget & button widget will be required).
- Ability to close windows!
- Use different approaches for painting bits. Use Z-curves and Hilbert curves (http://corte.si/%2Fposts/visualisation/binvis/index.html)
- Bigram visualization (like a 2-byte sequence histogram)
